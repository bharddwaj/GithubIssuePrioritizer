428,z-score is not usable in 2.14,"as first reported by @binokaryg in https://github.com/medic/medic-projects/issues/3828 the calculation of z-score does not work as expected in,2.14 . \r \r from further testing it appears that z-score calculations work _in isolation_ in,2.14 , but not when getting the sex and age from the patient context. from what i can tell this is because:\r - the z-score calculation finds fields using,appearance,eg,zscore-sex ,,zscore-age,so they must be ui elements\r - we avoid manually re-entering the age and sex by passing them from the patient's profile,via context or,db-object,and then have it assigned to a ui field using calculations\r - and as of 2.14 we should no longer use,calculation,on fields with ui input fields because of,unexpected results,https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/4134 .\r \r we previously used calculations like this, but it was an undocumented and unsupported feature, which we have since lost,_as is expected by undocumented features not in the spec_ . \r \r here are some possible alternatives, each requiring development and having their own pros and cons:\r 1,trigger the value change with actions and events, as per https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/4131. _setting the values as static currently defaults works._\r 1,allow the z-score calculation to find the fields without ui elements, perhaps with specific field names. _may be quickest to implement, but requires some custom and inflexible naming convention, which is not ideal._\r 1,modify the z-score calculation to be an xpath calculation. _this would be ideal since it brings the configuration of this function in line with all other xform functions we use. i seem to recall the reason we didn't do this in the first place was because of the async call to the z-score table._\r \r ----\r here is a test form:,issue_3828_4.zip,https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/files/1933337/issue_3828_4.zip \r \r,xml\r <?xml version=\ 1.0\ ?>\r <h:html xmlns=\ http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms\,xmlns:ev=\ http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events\,xmlns:h=\ http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\,xmlns:jr=\ http://openrosa.org/javarosa\,xmlns:orx=\ http://openrosa.org/xforms\,xmlns:xsd=\ http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema\ >\r,<h:head>\r,<h:title>growth monitoring</h:title>\r,<model>\r,<instance>\r,<issue_3828_4 delimiter=\,\,id=\ issue_3828_4\,prefix=\ j1!issue_3828_4!\,version=\ 2017-05-16 00:00:00\ >\r,<measurement>\r,<zscore>\r,<sex/>\r,<age_in_days/>\r,<zscore_sex/>\r,<zscore_age/>\r,<note_zscore_inputs/>\r,<zscore_weight/>\r,<zscore_height/>\r,<zscore_wfa/>\r,<zscore_hfa/>\r,<zscore_wfh/>\r,<wfa_message/>\r,<hfa_message/>\r,<wfh_message/>\r,<zscore_wfa_note/>\r,<zscore_hfa_note/>\r,<zscore_wfh_note/>\r,</zscore>\r,</measurement>\r,<meta tag=\ hidden\ >\r,<instanceid/>\r,</meta>\r,</issue_3828_4>\r,</instance>\r,<instance id=\ contact-summary\ />\r,<bind nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/sex\,type=\ select1\ />\r,<bind nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/age_in_days\,type=\ int\ />\r,<bind calculate=\,/issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/sex \,nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_sex\,required=\ true,\,type=\ select1\ />\r,<bind calculate=\,/issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/age_in_days \,nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_age\,required=\ true,\,type=\ int\ />\r,<bind nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/note_zscore_inputs\,readonly=\ true,\,type=\ string\ />\r,<bind constraint=\ . &gt;= 0.8 and . &lt;= 68.5\,jr:constraintmsg=\ body weight must be between 0.8 and 68.5 kgs.\,nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_weight\,required=\ true,\,type=\ decimal\ />\r,<bind constraint=\ . &gt;= 45 and . &lt;= 120\,jr:constraintmsg=\ body height must be between 45 and 120 cms.\,nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_height\,type=\ decimal\ />\r,<bind nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_wfa\,type=\ decimal\ />\r,<bind nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_hfa\,type=\ decimal\ />\r,<bind nodeset=\ /issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_wfh\,type=\ decimal\ />\r,<bind calculate=\ if,/issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_wfa,= &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, if,/issue_3828_4/measurement/zscore/zscore_wfa,&lt;

430,subclassing across native/python boundary to aid migration,"a major obstacle to the plan of a module-at-a-time bootstrapping of mypy is that current our generated extension classes can neither subclass nor be subclassed by interpreted classes.\r \r this means that a superclass needs to be moved to being compiled with mypyc at the same time as all of its subclasses. currently,,nodevisitor,is inherited from in 7 modules and,typevisitor,in 14.\r \r there are two directions this can be addressed in:\r 1. allow mypyc classes to inherit from interpreted classes. i think this won't be very hard, and i've managed to get an extension class to extend a interpreted class in manual testing. the downside is that the visitor interfaces can't switch to using efficient vtable calls until every implementation of the interface is working under mypyc.\r 2. allow certain mypyc classes to be extended by interpreted classes. i think the thing that makes the most sense is to allow traits to be extended. the tricky part is that generated code will make method calls to the trait via the vtable and we need to be able to redirect these calls to overridden interpreted methods. we can do this by generating wrappers for all of the trait methods that invoke the method via the c-api. if the method hasn't been overridden by an interpreted subclass, then it will end up back at the normal native implementation, and if it has it will end up calling the interpreted function.\r \r the main question then i think is: \ is it worth it to do,2 or should we just do,1 and figure we can migrate anything before it matters\ .",0.0,

466,redesign request: missing armor deals half damage,"this idea was very nice aesthetically and served a good purpose mechanically, but only really works in the midrange of armor stats. check out these corner cases:\r \r the full-armored squish: 100% coverage but zero as, dies like a dnd wizard because every shot is max damage.\r the armorless tank: have tons of fort and buy one medium armor arm rig with an armor mat. 90% of shots do half damage, and the other 10% has to get through your as. total cost: dirt cheap.\r \r i am of the opinion that it will make far more sense to set a permanent dividing line between shots that deal full or half damage. \r \r example section: for the sake of argument, lets say 60% of the average human is vulnerable to full damage per shot. further suppose that a target has 75% coverage. then:\r \r armor rolls of 1-60 would deal full damage, first to as and then to health.\r armor rolls of 61-75 would deal full damage to as and half damage to health. if a shot removes the last as, half the remaining damage is removed from health.\r armor rolls of 76-100 would deal half damage to health.\r \r if the target instead had 50% coverage, the difference would be that rolls in the 51-60 range deal full damage to health, ignoring as. the outer ranges would function the same. essentially, lighter armors may not cover all vulnerabilities, and heavier armors might be extensive enough to cover less vital areas.\r \r \r some implications:\r 1.,189 is a lot muddier since sometimes it will be better to roll low and other times it will be better to roll high on armor coverage,and other times, like in the above example, the best rolls are in the middle . this is actually already the case, but this proposal would make the muddiness more consistent across characters.\r 2. the dividing line between full and half damage shots provides another possible handle for balancing races. maybe plizards have fewer vulnerable organs than opaleites. maybe robots can spend a race trait to move that bar downward.\r 3. technically increases dice rolling as now 100% coverage characters may still have to roll.\r \r \r i would like to collect reactions from some number of devs before yellowlighting my own idea.",0.0,discussion

841,fix vector tile overdrawing with overlapping tiles from different zoom levels,"the tile loading logic in mapbox gl js attempts to load a parent tile in certain cases when a request for a child tile fails, e.g. the tile response is a 404, or a 200 with a content length of 0. this is intended to compensate for situations where tiles are not available at the current zoom level, but may be available at lower zoom levels, which could be overzoomed.\r \r unfortunately, this leads to overdraw in certain situations. i believe the primary situation,there may be others,involves:\r \r,a vector tileset that does not cover the whole world, i.e. tiles exist only for a certain bounding box. outside that bounding box, the mapbox tile api will respond with 404s.\r,layers sourced from this tileset that use semi-transparent styling.\r,a map viewport that intersects the bounds of the tileset.\r \r under these conditions, the map succeeds in loading one or more tiles at zoom,z,inside the bounds, but fails on one or more tiles outside the bounds. this triggers requests for tiles at,z-1,that succeed, returning tiles that overlap the child tiles. both parent and child tiles are rendered, producing overdraw.,the fallback loading behavior was originally implemented for fully opaque raster tiles, and semi-transparent vector tiles was not taken into account. \r \r multiple issues have been filed relating to this behavior:\r \r,4691, involving a transparent circle layer,jsfiddle,https://jsfiddle.net/nlindblad/nucky1bm/,:\r,! mapbox-bug,https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164991/25857886/42fcb304-34d2-11e7-8ee4-dbf6e3f1636f.gif \r,5829, similarly,demo,https://www.mapbox.com/help/demos/heatmap-gljs-dds/demo-3.html,:\r,! circle-zoom,https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8291663/33771091-635bce58-dbf5-11e7-958b-fef415a340d4.gif \r,6386, similarly,jsbin,http://jsbin.com/yobagowica/edit?html,output \r,! v44dds,https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17933661/37838375-1c89dad8-2e8e-11e8-8e4a-cfcc05a5e94e.gif \r,6560, with a heatmap layer,example,https://bl.ocks.org/j5kay/a50925604a76c892826e5d3a7db77ddd,\r,6754, with a fill-extrusion layer,jsfiddle,https://jsfiddle.net/9ou7r119/5/,\r \r iirc, we originally limited the parent tile fallback behavior to raster sources. this issue probably dates to when we expanded that behavior to vector sources as well. i can think of a few ways we might fix it:\r \r,revert loading parent tiles for vector sources. we'd have to go back and look at the rationale for that change and see if there's a different way that doesn't trigger this bug. \r,don't render parent tiles for vector sources when there's any successful child tile. probably don't want this because parent tile rendering is important to avoid showing empty areas during pans and zooms.\r,adjust the parent tile loading behavior to be smarter around tileset bounds. something like: don't load a parent tile when a child tile is near the bounds or when the parent tile intersects the bounds.\r,clip child tiles out of parent tiles during rendering. we did this for raster tiles in,5105.\r \r @kkaefer, @mollymerp you're most familiar with tile loading / clipping behavior. what are your thoughts?\r \r making this high priority since it's affecting multiple customers. cc @lilykaiser",1.0,

1339,more ideas about plugin system,"after some time spent on writing sqlalchemy plugin and a discussion with @jukkal here are some comments and ideas about our plugin :\r,currently, member signature hook is not called on,__init__,and,__new__ . current workaround is to use function hook, but it is still painful. the solution would require moving,type_object_type,and maybe a bunch of other helpers,from,checkmember.py,to a separate module,which is probably a good idea on its own . we can also move some helpers from,checker.py,related to type objects to the same module.\r \r,during semantic analysis types of expressions are not known. this poses a problem in attrs and even more in sqlalchemy: when generating an,__init__,method for a model, plugin needs to figure out what is a type of attributes from definitions like,name = column string 40,. currently i do this using some heuristics that works in 95% of cases,and so does attrs plugin , but a better solution is probably to just store names of \ magic\,classes,sqlalchemy models, dataclasses etc.,in the plugin state, add a dummy,__init__,to symbol table, and defer figuring out actual type to the method signature hook that is called in type checking,depends on fixing previous bullet .\r \r,it is better to move calling semantic analysis hooks to the very end, or,probably even better,just allow them to defer current target,but this is currently not possible .\r \r,we should not allow most type operations in semantic analysis hooks,we can't enforce it, but should at least document it clearly . some operations are still ok,like,map_instance_to_supertype,or,erase_type,.\r \r,the type checking hooks should also be able to defer current target using a special return value or an exception,e.g.,__init__,signature hook in the sqlalchemy example above if one would use a user-defined type in an import cycle .\r \r probably, most,or all,of decisions should be made after the upcoming,semanal.py,refactoring.\r \r,also function hook is inconvenient, but @gvanrossum already mentioned this in https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5409 that has a bunch of good ideas about improving plugin system.",0.0,needs discussiontopicplugins

around the world to use the libraries on our free cdn without any additional download/upload process.\r \r,how to deal with this issue?\r you can choose to add the library via single package.json or with its required assets. as for the working environment, you can choose to work on the github gui or on your computer,locally .\r working locally will let you learn git,version control,and debug skills. however, it needs more spaces on your computer in comparison with using github. so don't feel any pressure if you want to use the github gui. if you decide to work locally, it's recommended to pulling cdnjs repository with,sparsecheckout,https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/blob/master/documents/sparsecheckout.md,because the cdnjs repo is too huge.\r \r the followings are the useful steps to let you add the requested library with the github gui,in an easier way. :muscle:\r,via single package.json\r 1.,fork,https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/fork,the cdnjs repo and do the following steps on your forked repo.\r 2. create a new, non-master branch by clicking the \ branch: master\,dropdown and enter the name of the library being added.\r 3. create the file,<lib_name>/package.json,under,ajax/libs,directory by clicking \ create new file\,button. you will see the part of the screen like this image <img width=\ 477\,alt=\ 2017-09-01 1 39 56\,src=\

download/upload process.\r \r,how to deal with this issue?\r you can choose to add the library via single package.json or with its required assets. as for the working environment, you can choose to work on the github gui or on your computer,locally .\r working locally will let you learn git,version control,and debug skills. however, it needs more spaces on your computer in comparison with using github. so don't feel any pressure if you want to use the github gui. if you decide to work locally, it's recommended to pulling cdnjs repository with,sparsecheckout,https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/blob/master/documents/sparsecheckout.md,because the cdnjs repo is too huge.\r \r the followings are the useful steps to let you add the requested library with the github gui,in an easier way. :muscle:\r,via single package.json\r 1.,fork,https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/fork,the cdnjs repo and do the following steps on your forked repo.\r 2. create a new, non-master branch by clicking the \ branch: master\,dropdown and enter the name of the library being added.\r 3. create the file,<lib_name>/package.json,under,ajax/libs,directory by clicking \ create new file\,button. you will see the part of the screen like this image <img width=\ 477\,alt=\ 2017-09-01 1 39 56\,src=\

2367,the database migrations bug,"the bug\r during the past 2 database migrations, the databases of some of the users got updated past the \ max\,database version and some got incorrect values inserted into them.\r for example, between,v0.2.4,and,v0.2.5,we,bumped the main db version from,44.9,to,44.11,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusa/pull/4221 .\r however, during the migration to shift the quality values, some of the users got incorrect values inserted into the databases.\r in addition, some users database versions actually got bumped past,44.11 , to,44.12 , which caused an issue for users when the,next database migration,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusa/pull/4825,landed on,v0.2.9 .\r \r,what happens when medusa updates?\r currently, after medusa updates its code either using,git pull,or downloading the archive from github, it stops the web server and other threads, closes open files, etc.\r after that's done,,and unless the user had enabled the,no restart,option,, it spawns a new process of medusa with the same arguments as the one that was running.,source code,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusa/blob/ae29b17e1e489c7e0067f4bbd162965c8761b451/medusa/__main__.py l2097-l2105,\r \r,how does the restart process affect the database migrations?\r due to the use of process monitors or service restarters, which automatically restart a process if it dies, in-conjunction-with medusa's restart process,with,no restart,off ,\r medusa is being loaded,twice, at the same time, by two separate processes,.\r the database migrations,try to,execute on both processes at the same time, and in doing so, causing unexpected changes to database entries.\r \r the current docker configuration,ours,,@linuxserver's,https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-medusa,and possibly others,uses,s6 overlay,https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay writing-an-optional-finish-script,to automatically restart the server inside the container when it dies,source code,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusa/blob/ae29b17e1e489c7e0067f4bbd162965c8761b451/.docker/root/etc/services.d/medusa/run,.\r this means that as soon as the original medusa process dies out,,s6,spawns a new one, but medusa does too, which causes the scenario explained above.\r this can be,clearly,seen in the docker logs, if you restart medusa from the web ui, you can see duplicate log messages being logged, and the server tries to bind to the port twice - one of the processes worked, and the other says,it can't bind to the port because it's in use, and exits,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusa/blob/ae29b17e1e489c7e0067f4bbd162965c8761b451/medusa/server/core.py l292-l295 .\r \r,it's very possible any other platform that uses a service restarter may have this problem as well.,\r the,windows installation,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusainstaller,could also be affected.\r \r,what can be done _ incomplete _\r - medusa should not update versions inside docker containers.\r - the docker container should not be using a service restarter for medusa at all.\r - users should be using,watchtower,https://github.com/v2tec/watchtower,to monitor the docker container's status and update it to a newer version when one is available.\r - we possibly need to set the commit hash and version number when creating docker images, because when you run a docker container you first have to update it once using the updater in order for the version checker to work, just like you do when you install using an archive downloaded from github,source code,https://github.com/pymedusa/medusa/blob/ae29b17e1e489c7e0067f4bbd162965c8761b451/medusa/version_checker.py l867-l872,.\r - medusa's update system needs to be changed to be more configurable.\r \twe need to be able to conditionally disable updating and checking out branches, but still have the version checking, to notify users of a new version on the web ui in case they don't want to automatically update.\r \r,additional information:\r -\t>docker should only be updated via the container. we should disable the ability for medusa to restart inside of the container and just let docker restart the container instead. \r \t>\r \t>if users are using watchtower like most do it'll pull the new container, kill the old and rebuild using the new one. it should never change anything in the container after we build it and push to docker hub.\r \t>\r \t>the reason for this is you should be able to at any stage delete any container or even the whole server and as long as you have the files that you mapped to the container you should be able to fully recreate it on another system. it shouldn't matter about the container.\r -\t> if we change the docker container to not be updatable \r \t>... the medusa update system would become useless in the container.\r \t>right now if you install a new container you have to initialize it by manually updating medusa, which is problematic.\r \t>and because the commit hash is saved in the config file,and it doesn't use git , if you update outside of medusa, say - replace the container with a newer version, it would break the update system and,will also display,incorrect values under help & info.\r",0.0,bugdiscussionhelp wanted

ice sheets deliver fresh water and ice to the oceans. these estimates are provided by models, which, in turn, depend on our understanding of iceberg calving, among other processes. due to a lack of observations, the ability to project rates of iceberg calving needs improvement. this project works towards providing an inexpensive means of detecting and, potentially, characterizing such events, using the underwater noise generated by calving events. the data of this archive is limited to the set of underwater acoustic measurements collected in sarqardleq fjord in west greenland during the period 24-29 july, 2013.,the acoustic measurements were collected simultaneously with other observations which include surface wave and oceanographic measurements, along with high temporal resolution

at sample rate of 50000 hz, but\r,to reduce storage size data have been low-pass filtered and then\r,decimated to new sample rate of 10000 hz.,a qc check shows the\r,effective reduction in broad band noise level of less than 0.1 db as\r,result of the decimation . effective bandwidth of archived data is 5\r,hz - 5000 hz,10 khz sample rate . system receiving sensitivity was\r,-170 db re micropa/v, with 0 db gain. therefore, conversion of\r,wav-format data, limited to +/- 1, to acoustic pressure in pascals\r,is achieved by multiplying the wav-format data by 333.33.,the\r,maximum peak pressure that the system was capable of recording was\r,170 db re micropa, and on rare occasion this was exceeded briefly. \r,</para>\r,</section>\r,<section>\r,<title>acoustic recordings:

4640,heartbeat timeout is causing daemon connection to be reset,"each connection between a daemon worker and rabbitmq will have a timeout set. half this time is what is known as the heartbeat interval. each heartbeat interval, rabbitmq will send a request to each subscriber to confirm it is still alive. if the subscriber fails to respond to a heartbeat request within the timeout,i.e. it missed two consecutive heartbeats , rabbitmq will consider the subscriber to be dead and will close the connection.\r \r the timeout value is determined by the server by taking the minimum value of the default for the server and the value requested for the specific connection by the client. unfortunately, since rabbitmq 3.5.5 the default value for the server has been lowered from 580 seconds to 60 seconds. this means that the client, aiida, can at most set a timeout of 60 seconds. given that many tasks in aiida, such as ssh transport commands, can take more than 60 seconds, there is a large chance of it missing the heartbeat. this is the reason that rabbitmq was closing the connections, which resulted in the,socket error 104,from the,pika,library.\r \r unfortunately, the only way that the heartbeat timeout can be raised, is by changing the configuration of the rabbitmq server, which requires root privileges. however, having to configure rabbitmq is something we would like to prevent if at all possible, because it will greatly increase the difficulty of installing aiida.",1.0,topicworkflowstypebug

4642,calculation nodes need to be locked to prevent multiple workers running it,"due to the limited heartbeat timeout that is set by the default configuration of the rabbitmq server,see,1821 , the connection of daemon workers are often closed by the server. given the contract of rabbitmq,it guarantees that each task it receives will be completed, therefore as soon as it thinks a process, to which it has sent one or multiple tasks, is dead, it will requeue those tasks , when it closes the connection to a worker, it will requeue the tasks that that worker did not yet acknowledge, which will eventually be sent out to another worker. assuming that the worker is still alive and only missed its heartbeat because it was too busy too respond, it will potentially still be working on the tasks that will be resent. now there are two workers working on the same process, leading to race conditions and all sorts of problems, since aiida is not designed with concurrent operations on a single node in mind.\r \r therefore, a locking principle needs to be introduced that will lock a node for as long as a worker is operating on it. this lock needs to be released when the process is finished or the worker shutsdown or dies.",1.0,topicworkflowstypebug

amp-story-page differs from the size of the viewport, so common responsive practices that are based on the viewport dimensions won't work,e.g. media queries, and the viewport units,vw / vh / vmin / vmax,.\r \r we can resolve this by rewriting these styles at runtime to refer to the size of the,amp-story-page,rather than the viewport, but this becomes problematic once there are multiple possible,amp-story,elements in the document,as will be possible if/when the,standalone,attribute becomes optional .,as such, it becomes important to have scoping for a story's styles, so that we can

\r,page initialization\r,when a page is initialized, we should apply an attribute to the page that identifies the story from which it originates, in the format of,.i-amphtml-story-${id} .,for example,

7027,separate syntactic and semantic nodes?,"there is something that i was thinking about for a year or so that became more apparent while working on type alias refactoring,and planning the module refactoring . we have two different things mixed together in mypy code: syntactic nodes and \ semantic\,nodes. this is most obvious in,fixup.py,where we use,nodevisitor,interface,intended to traverse syntactic tree,to patch symbol tables,something that carries purely semantic info . as a result, there are various weird things like,visit_var ,,visit_type_info , etc. the idea is to have clear separation between syntactic and semantic nodes and have separate visitors for them. we currently already have this partially, we have,typeinfo,vs,classdef , and,var,vs,assignmentstmt .\r \r here is a _short,and approximate _ summary of the proposal:\r,there are following semantic nodes:,var ,,function ,,class,non-leaf, has symbol table ,,module,non-leaf, ditto ,,typevar ,,typealias ,,conditionalnode,see below .\r,the above nodes inherit from,symbolnode , while syntactic nodes inherit from,node , these two both inherit from,context .\r,only the above nodes,and types,are serialized in cache and deserialized in incremental runs.\r,semantic nodes can have attributes that point to the relevant,defining,syntactic nodes,for example variable can have defining assignment, or function statement if property , but we should limit this to minimize cache size.\r,the above nodes will have their separate visitor, so that in total we have three: for ast, for symbol tables, and for types.\r,conditionalnode,exists to avoid having,.nodes,instead of,.node,in,symboltablenode s,the latter are thin wrappers around semantic nodes , while still supporting certain conditional definitions like conditional imports. this node will have an attribute that is a list of other semantic nodes.\r \r this is a very large refactoring, but imo this will add robustness and clarity, and will simplify addition of new features,e.g. conditional imports . this is probably a low priority,long term,thing. we just discussed this with @jukkal, he likes the idea but is concerned about the size of this refactoring. a possible way to go forward with this is to split this in several separate prs.",-1.0,needs discussionrefactoringsizelarge

7170,re-work how fine grained targets are processed,"currently, fine grained targets are processed per updated module. this can lead to files being processed multiple times,and also a bit hard to reason, but this may be subjective . i propose to reorganise them to be processed in topologically sorted order. so the algorithm would be like this:\r 1. process all edited files, calculate all fired triggers, chain them to find all invalid targets, check for blocking errors.\r 2. group targets per module, order them per scc, then per same heuristics we use to order modules within sccs in coarse grained incremental. within module targets are ordered by line number, this is unchanged.\r 3. process targets in one module from the queue, calculate updated deps and fired triggers, update invalid targets queue,maintaining the sort order , check blockers\r 4. continue step 3 until no modules left in the queue at this scc\r 5. flush error messages\r 6. continue steps 3-5 until no sccs left\r \r this way it is much less likely that we will reprocess the same module twice. this will probably give an especially significant performance gain for cold runs, where many modules are updated w.r.t. to remote cache. also imo this algorithm is easier to reason about,and more similar to what happens in coarse-grained mode .\r \r this idea appeared some time ago, but was postponed. filing an issue to not forget about this.",0.0,needs discussionrefactoringtopicfinegrainedincremental

7384,dividers resulting from indirect overlap interrupt source dividers sometimes,"background:\r \r first, let me explain in simple terms how the midpoints between identity segments are selected.,the segments are stored in a \ solution\,data structure.,each sequence contains stretch records that are compatible with all other stretch records.,each sequence,a, b, c, & d,has stretch records,stretches 1..n,which are traversed from left to right and from each stretch, the sequences that the current sequence was aligned with is checked to find the closest stretch to the left and right of the current stretch and used to calculate a midpoint.,those midpoints are tracked in what i call a \ divider map\,i.e. the sequence map i generate at the end of the analysis .,each divider is labeled as either a \ source\,divider or a \ re-code\,divider.,source dividers tell the map that sequence should be obtained directly from a specific alignment where the identity stretch was found.,a recode divider indicates that the sequence must be recoded to match its partner that was involved in an identity stretch with a third sequence in that location.,each midpoint/divider i create is converted,using the relevant alignment,and copied to all the sequences' maps which the current sequence has been aligned with so that i can put together each piece of sequence by either recoding or alignment sourcing.,it was the divider coordinate conversion which was the first problem i had encountered - in cases where the midpoint fell inside a gap in another alignment.,the dividers would multiply and interrupt one another.,what i have implemented thus far solves the issue for a simple 1 versus all set of alignments.,the handful of warnings that come out are a check i devised to look for multiple dividers found between 2 \ closest\,segments, and from what i'd seen with the datasets you sent me, they all appear to be valid sets of dividers - but i kept the warnings in tact just in case i hadn't accounted for everything.,and i discovered the following problem...\r \r if you have 4 sequences,a, b, c, and d,and alignments between ab, bc, & cd; you can end up with dividers that interrupt one-another in a manner similar to the gap issue that i already reasonably solved.,the errors may or may not occur, based on the order in which i traverse the sequences.,what happens is, a's sequence map ends up selecting a source-divider,based on identity segments found in ab and bc.,we'll call the identity segments that divider1 is based on, ab1 and bc1.,divider1 is copied to b's sequence map as a source divider,which directs the sequence from there to the next divider to be obtained directly from the bc alignment .,then when b's identity segment records are traversed, it encounters an identity segment in c that was found in the cd alignment that falls between b's copy of divider1 and segment bc1.,from b's perspective, it doesn't have the identity segment from cd.,it only has its identity segments where it was identical with stretches in a and c.,so what ends up happening is a new divider,divider2,is created between cd1 and bc1 as a recode divider that interrupts the source divider \ divider1\,so that it can best match the segment found in cd.,had b's identity segments been traversed first, divider1 would not have been created because after creating \ divider2\ , when the region between ab1 and bc1 is searched while processing a's identity segment records, an existing divider in the region between ab1 and bc1 would have been found and re-used,given the way i had solved the gap-related issue .\r \r i do think that this problem can be solved.,i have mentally devised a plan that involves keeping track of the end coordinate of a source divider and performing a check to see if a recode divider being created or copied will fall inside a sourced region.,if it does, i can move the first poorly selected divider and propagate that move to all the other sequence maps.,but the solution is more involved than what i've done thus far.,given the alignment gap issue and the possibility that an identity segment can be present in more than 2 sequences,which i don't comprehensively keep track of in each map , propagating the changed divider might be tricky.,this fix would also eliminate all of the warnings which before, i could not distinguish between real problems and valid sets of dividers.",1.0,typebugcode1 designedeffort3 major
